# Barcode Detection Project ðŸ“·

My name is Filippo SamorÃ¬, and together with Enrico Battistini and Matteo Bonucci, we have developed this project as part of the final examination for the Computer Vision class in the Automation Engineering program at the University of Bologna.

This project focuses on developing an algorithm capable of detecting barcodes within gray-level images from a specific dataset. The algorithm identifies the Region of Interest (ROI) and calculates several quality parameters, which are then recorded in an Excel table.

For more details, I suggest referring to the attached PDF report.

Best regards,

Filippo SamorÃ¬ :smile:
